# Is There An Echo In Here?

## Abstract

For decades, audio engineers have been finding new and better ways to
improve the quality of their signals. From the basics of high-pass and low-pass
filters, to modern anti-feedback and echo cancellation algorithms, there is a
huge body of work both academic and practical. Operations monitoring and metrics
tools have also advanced rapidly in the last few years, leading to vastly
improved alerting and general awareness of system health.

This is not without a downside, however. As anyone that has been on the
receiving end of Nagios' flap detection or a graphite-induce pager store can
attest, the signal to noise ratio (itself an audio engineering term) has become
a problem for many organizations. At heart a stream of audio data and a stream
of metrics data are quite similar. This talk will explore some basic algorithms
from Digital Signal Processing you can use to level up your monitoring systems!
