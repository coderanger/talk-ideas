# Consumption is Fractal: Open Source and Sustainability

## Elevator Pitch

We all rely on open-source for just about everything in tech, but the past few
years have shown just how precarious most of the ecosystem is. More people need
to know about how to both support projects they rely on and run their own projects
more sustainably.

## Abstract

While open-source sustainability has been a common topic in the hallways tracks
and dev channels of major projects for years, the Heartbleed vulnerability in
2014 catapulted to topic in to the spotlight. Since then we've seen many
discussions about how open-source should be supported for the long term, but
rarely much action beyond a few token donations and some long Twitter threads.
In this talk we'll look at an overview of what kinds of projects are out there,
how sustainability works in real terms, and what techniques have worked or not
worked over the years.
