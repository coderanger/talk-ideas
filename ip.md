# Intellectual Property for Engineers

## Short Description

Intellectual property is everywhere in software. From licenses to copyright
headers, our world is one drenched in IP. Learning the basics of IP, the legal
protections it provides, and the requirements to use it successfully is
essential to navigating the modern technology landscape. Topics covered will
include the four branches of IP, how licenses work, why you need or don't need
a CLA, what constitutes fair use, and many other details of the IP world we all
live in.

## Abstract

Intellectual property is everywhere in software. From licenses to copyright
headers, our world is one drenched in IP. This talk will cover the essentials
of IP law in the US, giving engineers a leg to stand on in an increasingly
litigious world. Starting from the four branches of IP: copyrights, parents,
trademarks, and trade secrets, we will cover topics including licenses, CLAs,
fair use, the DMCA, and more.
