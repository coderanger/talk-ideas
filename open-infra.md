## Description

openness to our server infrastructure. Learn what has worked for our community,
and learn what is coming next for the Open Company.

## Audience

Open Company ethos.

## Objectives

Spread the message the being open with your customers and community both works
and provides continual benefits.

## Abstract

Since its founding, Balanced has embraced the principles of an Open Company.
Our customers have been front and center for our website and API development,
participating alongside our engineering team. We have found this philosophy
to be hugely rewarding both in developing long-term customer relationships and
recruiting the best engineering talent from the open-source world. Since joining
Balanced in 2013, I have been helping to guide our infrastructure and server
operations towards a similar goal. Our hope is that this will give our customers
even more transparency into how we provide our services, as well as provide a
living example of a best-practices-driven infrastructure. This talk will explore
the benefits we have found from the Open Company ethos, how we have opened our
operations process, and what we see as the next goals.
