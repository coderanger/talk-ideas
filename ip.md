# Intellectual Property for Engineers

## Short Description

Intellectual property is everywhere in software, especially in open
source. From licenses to copyrights, a working knowledge of IP law can
help you navigate the FOSS world more effectively as either a developer
or user.

## Abstract

Intellectual property is everywhere in software, especially in open source.
From licenses to copyrights, our world is one drenched in IP. This talk will
cover the essentials of IP law in the US, giving both open source developers
and users a working knowledge of the systems behind those big blocks of legal
text. Starting from the four main branches of IP, we'll cover topics like
copyrights, licenses, trademarks, CLAs, and more.
