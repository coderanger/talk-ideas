# Building Composable Services

## Blurb

Composable services and tools have been a hot topic lately. Learn why microservices can help bring your ideas to life faster while being more reliable and resilient. We'll show what frameworks and techniques you can use to build composable services and infrastructure, and help you avoid some of the common pitfalls.

## Description

This talk covers the major points of why microservices are becoming an increasingly powerful trend and how to get starting both as a builder and as a consumer of services.
