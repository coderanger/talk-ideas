# Our Pivot to GitOps

## Abstract

GitOps has been a sleeper buzzword lately. Not as popular as other *Ops ideas, but slowly gaining steam. My team recently decided to jump in and give it a try, and have been very impressed by the results. We have moved from a manual Jenkins and Ansible deployment model to GitOps powered by ArgoCD and Kubernetes operators. Come learn how we put things together, what snags we hit along the way, and what benefits we have seen from this transformation.
